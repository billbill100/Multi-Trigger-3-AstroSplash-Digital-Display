# Multi-Trigger 3 AstroSplash - Digital-Display
Adds a digital display to the HiViz MultiTrigger 3 and AstroSplash range of products

If you have purchased one of the excellent HiViz kits, but have found it dificult and time consuming to set it up again to previously used settings,
then this digital display is the answer.

It records and displays the delay setting from either or both of the Trigger-Timer3 & AstroSplash, making it easy to adjust to setting that have been previously used.

It is cheap & easy to build and simple to operate.

Using just a few parts, Ardiono Nano, 2 line Line LCD, LCD acrylic case, 2 resisters and some wires. it can be powered directly from the Trigger-Timer or via a USB supply.
Parts from AliExpress cost less than Â£10 (at time of writing) but the builder may alrady have some or all of them in their scrap-box.

The digital display has been used with Trigger-Timer 3 and AstroSplash. It has not been tried with the newer Trigger-Timer 3+ however, there should be no reason it should not be fully compatible with them.

If used with the AstroSplash, it will show all the 'TIME ON' settings and all 'TIME OFF' settings as well as the TriggerTimer 3 delay setting, laid out in the same format & orintation as the AstroSplash, for easy correltation.

I did contact Hiviz & offered them this project (free) for them to either sell as a kit of parts or add to their web site for customers to build themselves, however, the response was not positive. As I have a few Git projects, thought I might as well release it into the world.

If you do build it, I would be grateful for a few photos.
